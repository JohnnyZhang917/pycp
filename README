PYCP: cp with a progressbar

DESCRIPTION
-----------


Main idea : forking a file transfer in background,
while reading source and destination files.

Make use of the wonderful libraries progressbar by Nilton Volpato.

Comes with two scripts: pycp and pymv, calling FileTransferManager with
proper action (copy or move)

Also comes with pymv, a little script that uses pycp module, with an extra
option for removing files after copy.

INSTALL
------

Simply run:
  # python setup.py install

BUGS
---

Pycp would take much longer than cp if you're trying to monitor copy
of many little files

Option -f exists but does nothing
