PYCP: cp with a progressbar

-----------


Main idea : forking `cp` in background,
read size of source, and read size of
destination while copying.

Make use of the wonderful libraries progressbar by Nilton Volpato,
and subprocess to fork cp.

BUGS

Pycp would take much longer than cp if you're trying to monitor copy
of many little files
