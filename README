PYCP: cp with a progressbar

DESCRIPTION
-----------


Main idea : forking `cp` in background,
read size of source, and read size of
destination while copying.

Make use of the wonderful libraries progressbar by Nilton Volpato,
and subprocess to fork cp.

Also comes with pymv, a little script that uses pycp module, with an extra
option for removing files after copy.

INSTALL
------

Simply run:
  # python setup.py install

BUGS
---

Pycp would take much longer than cp if you're trying to monitor copy
of many little files
