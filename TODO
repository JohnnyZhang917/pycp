== General ==

* Stop using shutil, which is not well suited for our purpose.

Maybe write a function ala urllib.urlretrive:

   copyfile(source, destination, callback)

With callback() being called regulerarly with (block_count, block_size, total_size)

* Better handling of exceptional conditions:

Right now, it's probably possible to loose files when using pymv ...

== Packaging ==

Find a way to automate the packaging process, from the git tag to the publication
to Pypi, ubuntu PPA and AUR.
